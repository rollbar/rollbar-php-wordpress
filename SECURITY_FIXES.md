# WordPress Rollbar Plugin - CSRF Security Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) security fixes implemented in the WordPress Rollbar Plugin to address the vulnerability identified in version <= 2.7.1.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Admin Post Action Handler (restoreDefaultsAction)
**File:** `src/Settings.php`
**Issue:** No nonce verification or capability checks
**Fix:** 
- Added `wp_verify_nonce()` verification
- Added `current_user_can('manage_options')` capability check
- Added admin context verification

### 2. REST API Endpoint (/test-php-logging)
**File:** `src/Plugin.php`
**Issue:** `permission_callback` was `__return_true` (allowed anyone)
**Fix:**
- Changed permission callback to require logged-in users with `manage_options` capability
- Added nonce verification
- Added input sanitization callbacks
- Added admin context verification

### 3. Main Settings Form
**File:** `src/Settings.php`
**Issue:** Missing nonce field
**Fix:**
- Added `wp_nonce_field()` for CSRF protection
- Added nonce verification hook
- Added capability checks

### 4. Test Button Functionality
**File:** `public/js/RollbarWordpressSettings.js`
**Issue:** No CSRF protection in AJAX requests
**Fix:**
- Added nonce to localized script data
- Modified JavaScript to include nonce in test requests

### 5. Admin Menu Access
**File:** `src/Settings.php`
**Issue:** No verification for admin menu link access
**Fix:**
- Added nonce to admin menu links
- Added nonce verification for menu access

## Security Improvements Implemented

### Nonce Verification
- All form submissions now include nonce fields
- All AJAX requests include nonce verification
- Admin actions verify nonce before execution

### Capability Checks
- All admin functions require `manage_options` capability
- User permissions verified before any sensitive operations
- Proper WordPress role-based access control

### Input Sanitization
- REST API parameters sanitized using WordPress functions
- `sanitize_text_field()` for text inputs
- `absint()` for numeric inputs

### Context Verification
- Admin context verification for all admin functions
- Session validation for flash messages
- Proper request origin validation

### Session Security
- Flash message system protected against unauthorized access
- Session manipulation prevention
- Proper cleanup of session data

## Files Modified

1. **src/Settings.php**
   - Added nonce fields to forms
   - Added capability checks
   - Added nonce verification hooks
   - Enhanced security for all admin functions

2. **src/UI.php**
   - Added nonce field to restore defaults form
   - Fixed "WordPress" capitalization

3. **src/Plugin.php**
   - Fixed REST API permission callback
   - Added nonce verification to test endpoint
   - Added input sanitization
   - Fixed "WordPress" capitalization

4. **public/js/RollbarWordpressSettings.js**
   - Added nonce to AJAX requests
   - Fixed "WordPress" capitalization

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Nonce Verification**
   - Test form submissions with invalid/missing nonces
   - Verify nonce expiration handling

2. **Capability Checks**
   - Test with users having different permission levels
   - Verify unauthorized access is properly blocked

3. **REST API Security**
   - Test endpoint access without authentication
   - Verify nonce requirements
   - Test with invalid input parameters

4. **Form Security**
   - Test all forms with proper and improper nonces
   - Verify CSRF protection works as expected

## WordPress Standards Compliance

All fixes follow WordPress coding standards and security best practices:
- Uses WordPress nonce system (`wp_nonce_field`, `wp_verify_nonce`)
- Implements proper capability checks (`current_user_can`)
- Follows WordPress input sanitization patterns
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Uses WordPress admin context verification

## Impact

These security improvements significantly enhance the plugin's security posture by:
- Preventing CSRF attacks on all admin functions
- Ensuring only authorized users can perform sensitive operations
- Protecting against unauthorized API access
- Implementing defense-in-depth security measures
- Following WordPress security best practices

## Version Compatibility

These fixes are compatible with:
- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- All modern browsers supporting JavaScript

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enhanced security without performance impact
- Follows WordPress security guidelines
- Implements industry-standard CSRF protection
