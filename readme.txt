== Installation ==

The installation and configuration of the plugin are as simple as it can be.

= Through WordPress Plugin directory =

The easiest way to install the plugin is from the WordPress Plugin directory. If you have an existing WordPress
installation, and you want to add Rollbar:

1. In your WordPress administration panel go to `Plugins` → `Add New`.
2. Search for "Rollbar" and find `Rollbar` by Rollbar in the search results.
3. Click `Install Now` next to the `Rollbar` plugin.
4. In `Plugins` → `Installed plugins` find `Rollbar` and click `Activate` underneath.

**Warning**: This installation method might not be suitable for complex WordPress projects. The plugin installed this
way will be self-contained and include all of the required dependencies for itself and the `rollbar/rollbar-php`
library. In complex projects, this might lead to version conflicts between dependencies and other plugins/packages. If
this is an issue in your project, we recommend the "Packagist" installation method.

= Through Packagist =

*Note: this only works if your WordPress project is managed with Composer.
Read [Using Composer with WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/) for more details.*

This is a recommended way to install the Rollbar plugin for advanced projects. This way ensures the plugin and all of
its dependencies are managed by Composer.

You can install the plugin by running the following command in the root directory of your WordPress project:

```txt
composer require rollbar/rollbar-php-wordpress:^3.0
```

= Through WPackagist =

*Note: if your WordPress project is managed with Composer, we strongly recommend installing the plugin through
Packagist instead.*

*Installing the plugin from wpackagist.org instead of packagist.org will result in the plugin being managed by
Composer. However, the downside is that it's dependencies will not be managed by composer. Instead they will be packaged
in the plugin's `vendor` directory not in your project's `vendor` directory. This has the potential to cause name
collisions if other plugins or your project use different versions of the same dependencies.*

To install the plugin from wpackagist.org run the following steps command in the root directory of your WordPress
project:

```txt
composer require wpackagist-plugin/rollbar
```

= Configuration =

The plugin can be configured in the WordPress Admin or programmatically.

**WordPress Admin**

The plugin provides a settings page in the WordPress Admin that allows you to configure the plugin. This settings page
can be disabled by setting the `ROLLBAR_DISABLE_ADMIN` constant to `true` in your `wp-config.php` file.

1. In `Plugins` → `Installed plugins` find `Rollbar` and click `Activate` underneath.
2. Log into your [Rollbar account dashboard](https://rollbar.com/login/):
    1. Go to `Settings` → `Project Access Tokens`.
    2. Copy the token value under `post_client_item` and `post_server_item`.
3. In WordPress, navigate to `Settings` → `Rollbar`:
    1. Enable `PHP error logging` and/or `Javascript error logging` depending on your needs.
    2. Paste the tokens you copied in step 7 in `Access Token` section.
    3. Provide the name of your environment in `Environment`. By default, the environment will be taken from `WP_ENV`
       environment variable if it's set otherwise it's blank. We recommend to fill this out either with `development` or
       `production`.
    4. Pick a minimum logging level. Only errors at that or higher level will be reported. For
       reference: [PHP Manual: Predefined Error Constants](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php).
    5. Click `Save Changes`.

**Programmatic Configuration**

The plugin can also be configured programmatically. This is useful if you want to configure the plugin in a more
advanced way or if you want to disable the admin settings page.

```php
// wp-config.php

// Configure the plugin.
define( 'ROLLBAR_SETTINGS', [
    'php_logging_enabled' => true,
    'server_side_access_token' => '<your token>',
    'js_logging_enabled' => true,
    'client_side_access_token' => '<your client token>',
    'environment' => 'development',
    'included_errno' => E_ERROR,
    'enable_person_reporting' => true,
] );

// Optional: disable the admin settings page so the plugin is configured only programmatically.
define( 'ROLLBAR_DISABLE_ADMIN', true );
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Multisite supported? =
Yes, of course. Additionally, you can assign different environments to each of your blogs.

= I have a complex WordPress project and use composer for managing dependencies. Is your plugin composer friendly? =
Yes. It's actually the recommended method of installation. You can install the `rollbar/rollbar-php-wordpress` package
using composer.
